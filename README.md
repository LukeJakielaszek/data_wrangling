# data_wrangling

## Overview

Data was scraped from a total of 7 sources (2 for Illinois, 2 for Ohio, and 2 for Michigan). Each state has a csv file with scraped executive order information and another csv with general Covid-19 related counts. Unlisted / unobtainable data for an entry is left empty (null) in a CSV cell as not every source has complete information for each day. Dates are all caps in the form of "MONTH day, year"
